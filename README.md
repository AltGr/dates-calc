# A date calculation library

## Aim

This library handles dates (`DD-MM-YYYY`) and periods (in days, months and years). It provides operators on dates and periods. The addition of dates and periods containing months or years is a tricky case that may require roundings.

This library is a work in progress.

## Installation

Just run `opam install dates_calc` or `opam install .` if you've cloned the git repository.
